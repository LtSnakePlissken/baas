# Bridging-as-a-Service (BaaS)

Bridge-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a developer framework to build cross-chain bridges in a permissionless fashion. BaaS is a set of standardized contracts that form an API to leverage ElkNet's cross-chain message transport capabilities. Using BaaS, developers can build a bridge between two blockchains to implement arbitrary behavior, including bridging of tokens, cross-chain trades, data transfers, and combinations of the above.

## License

The BaaS codebase is distributed under a Business Source License (BUSL). See details in LICENSE.

## Current Limitations

BaaS is currently in Alpha 2, which means this is experimental software that may not offer the stability or security of Beta or General Release software.

The current BaaS API is complete. However, you should expect breaking changes in the API between Alpha and Beta releases. However, these changes will be minimal and target mostly the functions' signatures and naming, e.g., to add fees.

Currently, BaaS is available on the following testnets:
- Avalanche Fuji
- Polygon Mumbai
- Fantom Testnet
- Optimism Testnet
- Ethereum Ropsten

BaaS is also available on the following mainnets:
- Avalanche
- Polygon
- Binance Smart Chain
- Linea
- Q
